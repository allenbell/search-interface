# search-interface
Advanced search interface for an online database.
This was a project for a web databases course at the UNC Chapel Hill School of Information and Library Science.
It was designed to search a video database to which I no longer have access.
The interface includes search boxes for words within title, keyword search, fulltext search, and filters for year range, 
video duration (in seconds), videos with sound, and videos in color.
